# rest-api-base
<h2>Author: Zubair Blti</h2>

I have created a REST API project that handles various operations such as data insertion, fetching, updating, deletion, and search queries. All these functionalities are managed through the REST API.

In this project, the database is named rest_api_base, and it contains a table called api_table. The api_table consists of 5 columns:

ID (Primary Key)
name (stores the name)
email (stores the email address)
company (stores the company name)
designation (stores the job designation)
This project is designed to perform all database interactions efficiently through the API.
